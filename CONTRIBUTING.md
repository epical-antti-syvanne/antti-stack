# Contributing to Antti Stack

My personality is mine but it can be used to improve the world.

— Antti Syvänne

The code is MIT. The satire is a gift to whoever needs it.

## What this project is

Antti Stack is a tool for making enterprise absurdity visible and therefore survivable.
It does this through satire — not as decoration, but as a diagnostic instrument.

If you contribute, the satire must remain the primary conveyor of truth.
The code exists to make the diagnosis usable.

## What contributions are welcome

- Bug fixes and test improvements
- New enterprise signals, gravity patterns, or emotional weather hypotheses
- New meme templates that map to documented enterprise absurdity patterns
- OpenSpec signal-to-requirement mappings for new workplace anti-patterns
- CLI and MCP improvements
- Compression rule additions (ceremony phrases, filler patterns)
- Documentation that tells the truth without a transformation program

## What contributions are not welcome

- LinkedIn tone
- Vibes-based acceptance criteria ("I'm thrilled to announce" in commit messages)
- Features without a testable check
- Mocking named people, partner companies, or colleagues
- Emotional overclaiming ("the user feels overwhelmed")

## Voice guidelines

Satire must be:

- **Partner-safe**: target machinery, not people or companies
- **Affectionate**: sharp enough that people inside the joke can also laugh
- **Technically credible**: the absurdity is real, the exaggeration is measured
- **Dry**: Finnish deadpan, not stand-up

Read the Partner-Safe Satire Policy in TODO.md before writing satire content.

## Principles

- Mock systems, not people.
- Keep the joke technically accurate.
- Prefer one dry observation over five loud jokes.
- Remove corporate fog.
- If a phrase could appear in a transformation program brochure, treat it as suspicious.
- Keep vendor satire partner-safe. Product gravity is fair game; named-person flamewars are not.
- Add tests when behavior changes.
- Update docs when user-facing behavior changes.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```

For CLI smoke testing:

```bash
npm run dev -- --mode diagnose "Legacy invoice mapping uses ZZ_SUPP_REF_OLD2"
```

For MCP stdio smoke test:

```bash
npm run test:mcp
```

## Useful contribution types

- New corporate fog phrases and plain-language replacements
- ERP archaeology signals
- Emotional weather hypotheses that do not claim mind-reading
- Enterprise gravity patterns (platform lock-in, naming churn, admin portal archaeology)
- Governance theatre templates
- OpenSpec signal-to-requirement mappings
- CLI, MCP, memory, and schema improvements
- Documentation fixes, especially where the project accidentally becomes a brochure

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Does this reduce banality?
- [ ] Does this avoid LinkedIn influencer tone?
- [ ] Is the technical point still intact?
- [ ] Are systems mocked instead of people?
- [ ] Are vendor jokes defensible as process/platform satire?
- [ ] Does every new feature have a testable check (proof-not-press)?
- [ ] Did tests pass (`npm test`)?
- [ ] Did we avoid scheduling a workshop about it?
